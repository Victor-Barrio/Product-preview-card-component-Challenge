## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to combine the different photos of the product in the card, and how to make the transition between the desktop and mobile version of the card. I also learned how to combine Flexboc and CSS Grid to create a responsive layout.

### Continued development

I want to continue developing and improving whit CSS Grid and Flexbox. I want to learn how to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. I also want to learn how to use CSS variables to make the design more flexible and easier to change.
